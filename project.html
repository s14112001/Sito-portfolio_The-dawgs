        <h2>CROWD MAPPING SYSTEM
        </h2>
        <p>Description: Proxemics demonstrates how having too many dogs within a limited space can trigger negative behaviors, such as territoriality and aggressiveness. These affect the positive experience that dogs and owners should have in dog areas.

            This leads to a whole series of problems in managing relationships between the various dogs in the area, making the experience stressful even for the owners themselves.
